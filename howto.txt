    if you want to use : as a regex delimiter in the address expression, you need to escape the : itself not the following e character

    you have an unbalanced single quote

So either

sed "\:egrep:a alias cls='clear'" .bashrc

or simply

sed '\:egrep:a alias cls=clear' .bashrc

since you don't really need to quote clear here (if you ever do need to embed a single quote in a single-quoted expression, close the quote and then reopen it i.e. '\'').

To apply the changes to the file in-place, add the -i command line option.
