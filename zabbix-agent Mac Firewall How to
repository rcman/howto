The firewall is blocking the connection. Firewall option requires a bundle ID, which the zabbix agent binary does not have. To fix this, add a few rules to the firewall (running on there mac where your agent is):
# Open up a terminal window (Terminal can be found in the application folder or hit cmd-space and search for terminal)
# Backup the configuration file for the firewall
sudo cp -p /etc/pf.conf /etc/pf.conf.bak
# Edit the configuration file
sudo nano /etc/pf.conf
# Add the following commands to the end of the firewall config file (where nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn is the ip address of your server, viz 192.168.1.102:
block return in proto tcp from any to any port 10050
block return in proto tcp from any to any port 10051
pass in inet proto tcp from nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn to any port 10050 no state
pass in inet proto tcp from nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn to any port 10051 no state

# Save the modified config file (control-x)

# Load the updated config file:
sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

# launch the firewall
sudo pfctl -E

Your server should now be able to communicate with the zabbix agent running on your mac

If you are still having problems, have a look at the zabbix_agentd.log file from the console app. If the firewall is not configured correctly, you will see something like:
1574:20200910:053754.003 active check configuration update from [192.168.0.102:10051] started to fail (cannot connect to [[192.168.1.102]:10051]: [50] Network is down)

You may need to restart you zibbix agent:

sudo launchctl stop com.zabbix.zabbix_agentd
sudo launchctl start com.zabbix.zabbix_agentd

Your log file would now look something like:
